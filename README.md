# Something about me!

Niccolo Rametta

This is my repository

🧑‍💻 I’m Niccolo Rametta and this is what you need to know about me:

💻 I am a student of the institute ITIS Ettore Majorana who always tries to improve his digital skills and with desire to learn more things about the field.

🥊In my free time I practice boxing, a discipline that teaches you to always be aware of what you are doing at the moment, to reason about how to move in the future, and to make you more sure about what to do.

🏁I have two goals at the moment in my life: In computer science I want to aim to acquire skills of a certain level that will be useful when I go to work, while in boxing my goal is to reach the highest technical and competitive level.
